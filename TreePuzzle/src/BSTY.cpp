// the parent's height changes, then the grandparent's height should be checked and,
// if necessary, adjusted.  If the grandparent's height is updated, then the great-
// grandparent's height should be adjusted, etc.  The checking stops when either

/* must be removed using 1 or 2 above (why not 3?).  The heights must be adjusted after
